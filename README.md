# IS437 Final Project

For this project I made a basic website for a humane society or simple veterinarian office. Information for the organization would be stored in four tables- Users, Transactions, Animals, and Events. Employees can log in and are able to create, read, or update animal records. They can also create, read, and update info regarding certain events such as animal care/procedures or a user bringing in a new animal. General users that are not employees can view the general information about the organization, and the different animals available for adoption. In order to donate, adopt, schedule an appointment they must log in as a customer. 
 
## Use Cases:
* A user views the animals available for adoption
* A user donates money to the organization
* A user requests to adopt an animal
* A user makes an apointment to bring in their pet for a check up
* An employee schedules to test an animal for Heartworm
* An employee enters the result of a test
* An employee enters a new animal into the system
* An employee enters the results of an animal check up
* An employee updates an animal's information
